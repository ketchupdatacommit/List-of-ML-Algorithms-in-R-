# Statistical-Learning-Techniques

This is a Statistical Learning repository which will consist of various Learning algorithms and their implementation in R 
and their in depth interpretation. Below are the links to the implementation and their in-depth explanation of the learning algorithms in R. All the documents below contain the under-lying mathematical concepts explained with respect to a simple case study in R.


### Topics Covered :

1) Supervised Learning

2) Model Selection techniques - AIC, BIC, Mallow's Cp ,  Adjusted R-squared ,  Cross validation error.

3) Shrinkage Methods and Regularization techniques - Ridge Regression , LASSO, L1 norm, L2 norm.

4) Non-linear Regression and parametric models

5) Non-parametric model - K-nearest neighbor algorithm

6) Tree based Modelling - Decision Trees

7) Bayesian Modelling technique : Naive Bayes algorithm.

8) Ensemble learning - Random Forests, Gradient Boosting , Bagging.

9) Re-sampling methods and Cross Validation 

10) Unsupervised learning
